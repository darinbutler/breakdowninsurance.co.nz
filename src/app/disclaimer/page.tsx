              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">Nature of This Service</h2>
              <p>BreakdownInsurance.co.nz is operated by Cover4You as an independent information and comparison service for mechanical breakdown insurance (MBI) in New Zealand. We are not an insurance company, underwriter, or licensed financial adviser. We do not sell insurance products directly. Our service is to compare leading MBI providers based on publicly available information and link users directly to those providers&apos; own websites.</p>
              <p className="mt-3">Cover4You is not regulated as a financial advice provider under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The insurance products we reference are offered by independently licensed insurers and underwriters who operate under their own regulatory obligations.</p>
